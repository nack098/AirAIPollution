i'm not sure how to use these files outside of python, this is how i use it in python

model is exported to `model.keras` and the used scaler is in `std_scaler.bin`
load model with `keras.models.load_model()`
load std_scaler with `joblib.load()`
then follow the #predict me! block of code as to how to get output

uhh if its in js then maybe check [tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/guide/models_and_layers)
and then load or retrain data that way

kthnx have fun
