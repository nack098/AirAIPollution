i'm not sure how to use these files outside of python, this is how i use it in python

model is saved to `model.keras` and the used scaler is in `std_scaler.bin`
model is also exported to the `model` directory using `tf.keras.Model.export` i guess im not sure what it really does
load model with `keras.models.load_model()`
load std_scaler with `joblib.load()`
then follow the #predict me! block of code as to how to get output

uhh if its in js then maybe check [tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/guide/models_and_layers)
and then load or retrain data that way

kthnx have fun
